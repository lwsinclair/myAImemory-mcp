| Memary | Human-like memory for agents | Graph database | Agent-focused | Human memory emulation |
| Cognee | Reliable memory for AI apps | Multiple storage options | Data pipeline focused | Extensive data source integration |

**Key Advantages of myAImemory-mcp:**
- **Privacy-First**: All data remains on your device, no personal information sent to external servers
- **Performance**: Leverages Claude's caching capabilities for dramatic speed improvements
- **Simplicity**: Natural language updates to your preferences across all Claude interfaces
- **MCP Integration**: Purpose-built as a Claude MCP for seamless integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Jktfe/myaimemory-mcp.git
cd myaimemory-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript code
npm run build

# Start MCP server (with stdio transport)
npm start

# Or start with HTTP transport
npm run start:http
```

### 🧠 Server Options

The unified server script supports multiple options:

```bash
# Start with stdio transport (default)
./start-server.sh

# Start with HTTP transport
./start-server.sh --http

# Start with HTTP transport on custom port
./start-server.sh --http --port=8080

# Start with direct implementation (no SDK)
./start-server.sh --direct

# Start with direct implementation and HTTP transport
./start-server.sh --direct --http

# Enable debug mode
./start-server.sh --debug
```

### 🔄 Direct Sync Method (Simple Alternative)

For a simpler approach that doesn't require running an MCP server, you can use the unified CLI:

```bash
# One-time sync of all memory files
npm run sync

# Or for emergency sync (fixes permissions)
npm run sync:emergency
```

This script will:
- Read from your "myAI Master.md" file
- Update all CLAUDE.md files in your projects
- Update your Windsurf memory settings
- All without storing sensitive information in the git repository

### 🔒 Privacy and Security

- The "myAI Master.md" file with your personal information is excluded from git tracking
- All CLAUDE.md files are also excluded to protect your privacy
- Use the included `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive files remain private

### 🗣️ Supported Natural Language Commands

You can interact with myAI Memory using these natural language patterns:

| Command Pattern | Example | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| `Use myAI Memory to remember [information]` | "Use myAI Memory to remember I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript" | Adds information to the appropriate section based on content |
| `Remember that [information]` | "Remember that I live in London" | Shorter alternative to add information to memory |
| `Add to my memory that [information]` | "Add to my memory that I have two cars" | Another way to add information to memory |
| `Use myAI Memory to add to [section] [information]` | "Use myAI Memory to add to Coding Preferences I prefer dark mode" | Add information to a specific section |
| `Update my [section] to include that [information]` | "Update my User Information to include that my birthday is March 29" | Update a specific section with new information |

Note: To perform a full sync across all platforms, use the command line: `node sync-memory.js`

```
You: Use myAI Memory to remember I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
Claude: ✅ Added to your Coding Preferences! I'll remember you prefer TypeScript over JavaScript.
```

```

## 🧙‍♂️ System Prompt Integration

For best results, add this to your Claude system prompt:

```
Memory Integration Instructions:
When you receive a command that starts with "use myAI Memory to", you should:

1. Process the rest of the instruction as a memory management command
2. Try to determine the appropriate section to update based on the content
3. Use the myAI Memory Sync MCP to update your memory
4. Confirm the update with a brief acknowledgment

For example:
"use myAI Memory to remember I prefer dark mode" 
→ Update the preferences section with dark mode preference

When asked questions about preferences or personal information, first check your memory via the myAI Memory Sync MCP. Always reference information from memory rather than making assumptions.
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

We take your privacy seriously:

- All data remains locally on your device
- CLAUDE.md files are automatically added to .gitignore
- No data is sent to external servers (except when using the optional Anthropic API integration)
- Works with encrypted file systems for maximum security

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CLAUDE.md Not Updating**
   - Check file permissions with `ls -la CLAUDE.md`
   - Try emergency sync with `./emergency-sync.sh`
   - Verify platform paths in your `.env` file

2. **MCP Connection Failures**
   - Ensure MCP server is running with `ps aux | grep myai-memory`
   - Check Claude Desktop logs for MCP errors
   - Verify your Claude Desktop configuration file

3. **Caching Issues**
   - Clear cache with `node dist/cli.js --clear-cache`
   - Verify Anthropic API key is correctly set
   - Check memory file integrity with `node dist/cli.js --validate`

4. **Natural Language Commands Not Working**
   - Make sure to use exactly one of the supported command patterns (see Supported Natural Language Commands section)
   - If Claude doesn't recognize your command, try a different pattern
   - For syncing across all platforms, use the direct script: `node sync-memory.js`

### Manual Syncing

If you're experiencing issues with natural language commands or the MCP server:

```bash
# Direct sync approach (most reliable)
cd /path/to/myAImemory
node sync-memory.js

# Alternative emergency sync (if permissions need fixing)
cd /path/to/myAImemory
./safe-memory.sh sync
```

These methods directly read from your master file and update all platforms without relying on the MCP server or natural language processing.

### Logs and Debugging

Enable debug mode to see detailed logs:

```bash
DEBUG=true npm run start
```

Log files are stored in:
- Linux/macOS: `~/.local/share/myai-memory/logs/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\myai-memory\logs\`
